# GreenFisher üêü üé£ü§ù
My app project consists of a 2D game based on a retro GameBoy style. The objective of the game for player and friend is to reach 99 pounds of fish first. The experience I want to share is outdoor fishing, the feeling of freedom, and nostalgia. The message of relaxation with friends, many times we only focus on work and forget to relax. The summary of my interactive scene would be to remember the moment and experiences we had with our friends. 

## Requirements
* Xcode 13.3.1 or higher    
* iOS 15.2 or higher


## Technologies
### Apple frameworks
* **[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)** - Life cycle    
* **[Spritekit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/)** - Draw the scenes, create animations and simulate physics  
* **[GamePlayKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/GameplayKit_Guide/index.html)** - Randomization and state machines


## How to Play
To play just press the button in the lower right corner to start fishing, when a warning pops up just press it again before the fish gets away, it is also possible to move around the map and fish in other parts of the lagoon using the gamepad in the lower left corner. It is recommended to use the iPad in landscape mode for the best experience.
